# Userdata

The ```userdata.dll``` handles the deletion of user data folders, displaying a cancel-able progress bar and a list of any failed operations. It is written in Pascal and must be compiled with a 32-bit Unicode Delphi.

The ```HostDebug.exe``` is provided so you can run the debugger in the dll.
